# Credit Card number recognition

Problem Statement:
Scanning of images and extracting the text written in the images is of much research within
the computer vision and machine learning communities and detection of text and identification
of characters in scene images is a challenging visual recognition problem. Apart from being
useful in the Artificial Intelligence field it also has broad practical applications ranging from
scanning the credit card/debit card or scanning the number plates of car. We design and build
algorithm to detect text from images using the concepts of machine learning and deep learning.

The Motivation:
The pace of more and more advanced technology is accelerating at a rate faster than ever. The
technology by which we were fascinated the most is Machine learning and its applications and
were motivated to build a project using these techniques. The implementation of algorithms
used for text recognition in particular got our interest. This project will help us understand the
fundamentals of Optical Character recognition and image scanning.

The Objective:
 In this project we are going to process images.
 The algorithms used will extract textual data from a credit/debit card or license plate of
a car.
 These algorithms can further be used to recognise faces, identify objects, track objects in
videos.
 The project will help us make us aware of the researching aspect of any project development
task.

Methodology:
The project aims at detecting the textual information by scanning the images of credit/debit
card that will be provided as input. This can be achieved by Optical Character recognition
which will process the image. Image will be imported by digital photography We will get card
number, type of card and expiry date as output.

Hardware and Software requirements:
 We will be using the programming language Python developed by JetBrains and will be
working on its integrated development environment- Pycharm.
